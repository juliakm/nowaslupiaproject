Although my great-grandfather, David Fructman, left <sbr />Nowa Slupia in 1913, his family lived for at least 100 years in <sbr />this town. We arrived in Nowa Slupia armed with a photo that <sbr />David had kept in his prayer book and the only words that <sbr />David ever spoke of his life in Poland, &quot;Good Riddance.&quot;</font></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left"></p>

It lies at the border <sbr />of a Polish National Park, The Gory Swietokrzyskie, and <sbr />a forested mountain ridge rising to 600 meters (about <sbr />2000 feet) that was a center of armed resistance to the <sbr />Nazis during WWII. According to the 1931 census, <sbr />approximately 1,000 of the 1,600 residents of Nowa <sbr />Slupia were Jewish.</font></p>

David Fructman, my <sbr />great-grandfather, was born in Nowa Slupia on January <sbr />26, 1869. When he was 44, David took the &quot;Amerika&quot; <sbr />ship from Hamburg, Germany to Toronto, Canada via <sbr />Ellis Island. He eventually settled in Los Angeles, where <sbr />he had eight children. David would later bring his <sbr />immediate family, brothers and sister from Nowa Slupia <sbr />to North America. His mother, Shirley, remained in <sbr />Poland, and he returned to visit her near the end of her <sbr />life. I went with my parents, Norman and Kathy, and my <sbr />brother Hans to Nowa Slupia in 2003.</font></p><p align="left"></p>

I am a master&apos;s student in <sbr />Information Science at UNC&apos;s School of Information and <sbr />Library Science. My family and I went to Nowa Slupia in <sbr />2003 to search for the story of our relatives. After going <sbr />on the trip I never wanted to think about Nowa Slupia <sbr />again. However, I have since discovered that there is <sbr />nothing online about the Jews of Nowa Slupia. This <sbr />website is an attempt to share what we learned on the <sbr />trip for anyone else researching what happened to the <sbr />Jews of Nowa Slupia and that Polish region.</font></p>

Traditionally, Jews researching their genealogy can look in Yizkor books for accounts of what happened to their town and relatives during the Holocaust. Yizkor books are accounts of Jewish life in Eastern and Central Europe towns published by groups of former residents, often Holocaust survivors who have found each other in Israel or America. Unfortunately, no survivors have written about Nowa Slupia. As a result, my dad, Norman, had to use other means to research Nowa Slupia.Before we left, he had already obtained the birth certificate of his maternal grandfather, David Fruchtman. From the birth certificate, he found out that David was born in Nowa Slupia on January 26, 1869. Norman also brought with him a photo of a family in Nowa Slupia that David, an Orthodox Jew, had carried with him in his prayer book each day [Image: Prayer].From the Ellis Island passenger records, Norman also discovered that, at age 44, David departed on the "Amerika" from Hamburg, Germany in route to Toronto, Canada via Ellis Island [Image: Ellis]. He arrived at Ellis Island December 20, 1913. David's residence on his passenger records was written as "Slupia, Russia" (in 1913 Nowa Slupia was part of Russia).On a side note, one of the unique challenges of searching for information on the Fruchtman family is that the name changes depending on the historical document. For instance, David Fruchtman is also known as David Fruchtmann and David Frochtman.

It would have been very difficult to find Nowa Slupia and communicate with anyone without the help of our guide, Joanna. Joanna is a graduate student in Krakow focusing on Jewish Studies. She recently discovered that she was part-Jewish and is now a practicing Orthodox Jew [Image: Guide].Joanna first led us to Kielce, the county seat. The Hall of Records in Kielce is inside of a former synogogue [Image: Records].At the Kielce Hall of Records, we found David's parents' marriage certificate: this document stated that David's parents, Israel Frochtman (born 1843 in Nowa Slupia) and Sosia (Mandel) Frochtman (born in 1845 to Majer & Prywa Mandel of nearby Lagow), were married on July 6, 1864 in Opatow.Later, we went to Opatow. Opatow is the closest major town to Nowa Slupia. In Opatow, we also found a small, unkept memorial to the Jews of the city who died in the Holocaust in a park that used to be the Jewish cemetery. The park consisted of about twenty-five acres of forested area, with a school built in the center. At the back of the park, near where a handful of teenagers were drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, we found the only evidence of Jewish life in Opatow: flat on their back, facing skyward, nine concrete slabs embedded with partial Hebrew gravestones arranged in the shape of a menorah [Image: Opatow]. There was no other evidence that the park had been a cemetery, although there was a peculiar broken concrete sculptor that included a Star of David near the park's entrance.

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="13" color="#ffffff" letterSpacing="0.000000" kerning="1">We first realized that we were in Nowa Slupia when we <sbr />passed the town sign [Image: Sign]. Our first destination <sbr />was the town&apos;s Tourism office. Outside the tourism <sbr />office, we found a map of the nearby national forest <sbr />[Image: Map]. Since the primary duty of the Nowa Slupia <sbr />tourism office is to direct visitors to the forest, the <sbr />operator was a bit taken aback by our questions about <sbr />the long-lost Jews of Nowa Slupia. </font></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="13" color="#ffffff" letterSpacing="0.000000" kerning="1">However, after our translator explained the situation, he <sbr />immediately sought to help us and called a woman who <sbr />he said would recall the Jews. She agreed to meet with <sbr />us. He closed the tourist office and walked us the <sbr />approximate one-quarter mile to her home located on a <sbr />dirt road across a creek behind the town center [Image: <sbr />Road]. We soon met Michalina Rybczynska, the oldest <sbr />woman in the village, and her family [Image: Michalina].</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="13" color="#ffffff" letterSpacing="0.000000" kerning="1">Later, Michalina&apos;s son offered to put Michalina into our <sbr />car and have her point out the locations where once <sbr />there was Jewish establishments, including the <sbr />cemetery. Michalina showed us the center of the town, <sbr />where Jews once worked [Image: Town I]. </font></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="13" color="#ffffff" letterSpacing="0.000000" kerning="1">She said that Jews worked at the fruit market, butcher, <sbr />tailor, the bakery, and cafe [Image: Town II]. At the <sbr />cemetery she would not get out of our car &quot;because she <sbr />didn&apos;t want to cause trouble for her family." </font></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="13" color="#ffffff" letterSpacing="0.000000" kerning="1">The former Jewish cemetery, our last stop with <sbr />Michalina, was now a fire station with a field adjacent <sbr />[Image: Cemetery I &amp; II]. There were no gravestones. <sbr />There was no memorial plaque. There was no evidence <sbr />that this land was the resting place of anyone.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="13" color="#ffffff" letterSpacing="0.000000" kerning="1">We never found out what exactly happened to the Jews <sbr />of Nowa Slupia. Holocaust records show that Treblinka <sbr />Concentration Camp took in people from Nowa Slupia at <sbr />the same time that Michalina indicated the town&apos;s Jews <sbr />disappeared. As a result, we left believing that the <sbr />majority of Nowa Slupian Jews died in the Holocaust. <sbr />However, no one in Nowa Slupia could confirm this. It is <sbr />as if Jews never lived in the town.</font></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="13" color="#ffffff" letterSpacing="0.000000" kerning="1">All of us who went to Nowa Slupia left with different <sbr />impressions. My dad left thinking that he did not have <sbr />the resolution he had hoped to find. My mom saw it as <sbr />an adventure that we would always remember. She <sbr />believes that understanding one&apos;s historical roots is <sbr />essential to understanding our current belief systems <sbr />and philosophical underpinnings. &nbsp;Hans and I were left <sbr />depressed and questioning why no one ever looked for <sbr />the Jews of Nowa Slupia after the war. </font></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="13" color="#ffffff" letterSpacing="0.000000" kerning="1">Listen to the audio to hear our stories.</font></p>
